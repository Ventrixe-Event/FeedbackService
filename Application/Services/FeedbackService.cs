/**
 * FeedbackService Business Logic Implementation - Application Service Layer
 *
 * Purpose: Concrete implementation of feedback management business operations
 * Features:
 * - Complete CRUD operations with result pattern error handling
 * - Rich mock dataset with realistic feedback scenarios
 * - Entity-to-DTO mapping for clean data transfer
 * - Event-specific feedback filtering and retrieval
 * - Exception handling with graceful error responses
 *
 * Architecture: Part of the Application layer in clean architecture
 * - Implements IFeedbackService interface for business logic
 * - Uses repository pattern for data access abstraction
 * - Provides mock data for development and demonstration
 * - Implements result pattern for consistent error handling
 *
 * Mock Data Details:
 * - 10 diverse feedback items across 9 event categories
 * - Categories: Music, Fashion, Food & Culinary, Art & Design, Technology, Social, Sports, Business, Entertainment
 * - Realistic user feedback with varied ratings and detailed comments
 * - Event association for comprehensive feedback analysis
 * - Mixed rating distribution (4-5 stars) representing positive feedback scenarios
 *
 * Author: Kim Hammerstad (with AI assistance from Claude 4)
 * Created: 2024 for Ventixe Event Management Platform
